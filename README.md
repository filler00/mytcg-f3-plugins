# MyTCG-f3 Plugin Registry.
The MyTCG-f3 plugin registry is a convenient directory of MyTCG-f3 plugins that are hosted on GitHub. This gets pulled directly into the MyTCG-f3 plugin admin panel to help users conveniently find and install plugins in a few clicks.

## Get Listed
Want to add a plugin that you created to the registry? Great! We only require that your plugin source code is hosted on GitHub. 

To request to add your plugin to the registry, or to request modification or removal of plugin information:

* Add/modify your plugin information in the `registry.json` file and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/filler00/mytcg-f3-plugins/edit/master/registry.json).
* [Create a new issue](https://github.com/filler00/mytcg-f3-plugins/issues/new) containing the link to your plugin's repository on GitHub.
* Post your request to the [MyTCG-f3 support forums](https://forum.filler00.com/conversations/mytcg-f3) (we will not accept modification or removal requests using this method)

For requests initiated via GitHub, **you must be logged in as the owner of the plugin's repository** or your request will be denied.
